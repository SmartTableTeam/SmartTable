# SmartTable

## Run Front End
---
---





## Database Setup Instructions
---
---
1. Pull the latest changes from github
2. Open pgAdmin and create a database named 'smart_table'
3. Open a 'QueryTool' panel in pgAdmin for the smart_table database
4. Copy the script in '/BACK_END/db_setup_scripts/initialize-database.sql' then paste and run it in pgAdmin
5. Open '/BACK_END/demo_config.js' and follow the instructions in the file
  Make sure to **COPY** and **RENAME** demo_config.js, otherwise you risk accidentally pushing your postgres password to the repository.
6. Open a terminal, and navigate to the BACK_END folder.
7. Run 'npm install'
8. Run 'nodemon'
9. The back end should now be running and ready to receive requests! If not, I can help.
To test this, go to 'http://localhost:1701' and you should see a simple page with some buttons. This is a page I use to test end points, and show what the response data looks like
